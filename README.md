Welcome to the **Travel and Accommodation Booking Platform**, a full-featured travel booking system similar to Booking.com or Expedia. It allows users to search for hotels, book rooms, and receive invoice confirmations via email. Built using **Clean Architecture**, **CQRS**, and modern backend development principles with ASP.NET Core, including user authentication, booking management, city and hotel administration, discounts, reviews, and more.

## üóÇ API Versioning

This platform follows **URL Segment Versioning** to ensure backward compatibility and support for future API enhancements.

All endpoints are versioned using the URL path (e.g., `/api/v1.0/...`), making it easy to manage and evolve the API without disrupting existing clients.

- **Current Version**: `v1.0`

### üîç Example Usage

```
GET /api/v1.0/hotels
```

This design allows consumers of the API to:

- Use a specific version without being affected by breaking changes.
- Easily upgrade to newer versions when ready.

## üß™ Unit Testing

Unit testing is a critical part of this platform to ensure reliability, maintainability, and correctness of the business logic. Two separate test projects are maintained:

    _mockMapper.Setup(m => m.Map<BookingResponseDTO>(It.IsAny<Booking>()))
               .Returns(expectedResponse);

    var result = await _handler.Handle(command, CancellationToken.None);

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The **Travel and Accommodation Booking Platform** is architected using the **Clean Architecture** approach to ensure modularity, separation of concerns, and maintainability.

We adopted several modern design patterns such as **CQRS**, **MediatR**, and **Dependency Injection**, along with clearly separated layers to build a scalable and testable solution.

### üìå Overview Diagram

![Architecture Overview](./assets/Architecture_Used.png)

This diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of the platform. Each layer has its own distinct responsibility and does not depend on the infrastructure or external tools directly.

### üß± Layered Architecture

#### üîπ Presentation Layer (`WebAPI`)

- Exposes RESTful endpoints.
- Uses controllers to receive requests and delegate them to the application layer.
- Hosts the Swagger documentation for easy API testing.
- Handles HTTP responses and status codes.

#### üîπ Application Layer

- Contains all business logic, commands, queries, DTOs, and validators.
- Implements **CQRS** using **MediatR**.
- Uses **FluentValidation** for input validation.
- Uses **AutoMapper** for mapping between domain models and DTOs.
- This layer depends only on the domain (Core) layer and is completely framework-independent.

#### üîπ Domain Layer (`Core`)

- Defines domain entities such as `User`, `Hotel`, `Booking`, `RoomClass`, etc.
- Contains domain-specific interfaces for repositories and services.
- Defines value objects and enums like `PaymentType`, `HotelStatus`, and `RoomType`.
- Represents the **core business rules** of the application.

#### üîπ Infrastructure Layer

- Implements interfaces defined in the Domain layer.
- Manages the database access using **Entity Framework Core**.
- Implements external integrations like:
  - **JWT Authentication**
  - **PDF generation using QuestPDF**
  - **Email sending via MailKit**
  - **Image storage using AWS S3**
  - **Logging using Serilog**
- Responsible for setting up dependency injection, seeding, and migrations.

## üß© Database Schema Design

The platform uses a **relational database schema** built with **Entity Framework Core** and follows **normalized** design principles to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance.

It covers all major entities involved in the travel and accommodation booking lifecycle, such as Users, Hotels, Bookings, Rooms, Discounts, and Reviews.

Here‚Äôs a visual overview of the schema:

### üß± Tables & Relationships Overview

| Entity            | Description                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Users**         | Stores user credentials and personal data. Connected to Bookings, Reviews, and Roles.                       |
| **Roles**         | Defines system roles like Admin, User, Owner. Many-to-many relation with Users via `UserRole`.              |
| **UserRole**      | Join table linking Users and Roles (many-to-many).                                                          |
| **Cities**        | Represents geographical locations. One-to-many with Hotels.                                                 |
| **Owners**        | Represents hotel owners. One-to-many with Hotels.                                                           |
| **Hotels**        | Central entity representing a hotel. Related to City and Owner. Has many RoomClasses, Bookings, Reviews.    |
| **RoomClasses**   | Represents types of rooms in a hotel (e.g., Deluxe, Suite). Related to Hotel. Has many Rooms and Discounts. |
| **Rooms**         | Individual physical rooms under a RoomClass. Related to Bookings and InvoiceDetails.                        |
| **Bookings**      | Holds reservation data. Connected to Rooms (many-to-many), InvoiceDetails, and Users.                       |
| **BookingRoom**   | Join table for Bookings and Rooms (many-to-many).                                                           |
| **InvoiceDetail** | Stores financial details per room per booking.                                                              |
| **Discounts**     | Represents offers on RoomClasses.                                                                           |
| **Reviews**       | User-generated feedback for Hotels. Related to Users and Hotels.                                            |
| **Images**        | Polymorphic table (linked to multiple entities) to store image URLs.                                        |

### üîÅ Example Relationships

- **One-to-Many:**

  - City ‚ûù Hotels
  - Owner ‚ûù Hotels
  - Hotel ‚ûù RoomClasses
  - RoomClass ‚ûù Rooms
  - RoomClass ‚ûù Discounts
  - User ‚ûù Bookings / Reviews

- **Many-to-Many:**
  - User ‚¨å Role (via `UserRole`)
  - Booking ‚¨å Room (via `BookingRoom`)

---

### üß† Design Rationale

- **Normalization:** Ensures data redundancy is minimized and relations are clear.
- **Scalability:** Allows future extensions (e.g., adding Payment Gateway, Loyalty Points).
- **InvoiceDetail:** Decouples financial logic per room and supports flexible invoicing and reporting.
- **Polymorphic Images Table:** Enables image support for Hotels, RoomClasses, etc., without duplicating structure.
- **Precision in Pricing Fields:** All `decimal` fields (like `PriceAtReservation`, `TaxAmount`) are stored with precision `(18,2)` to maintain accuracy in financial calculations.
